  "readme": "node-exif\n=========\n\nWith _node-exif_ you can extract Exif metadata from images (JPEG). Exif is a\nformat used, for example, by digital cameras and scanners to save additional\ninformation about an image in the image file. This information can be the\ncamera model, resolution, where the image was taken (GPS) or when it was taken.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstalling using npm (node package manager):\n\n    npm install exif\n    \nIf you don't have npm installed or don't want to use it:\n\n    cd ~/.node_libraries\n    git clone git://github.com/gomfunkel/node-exif.git exif\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nEasy. Just require _node-exif_ and throw an image at it. If _node-exif_ is able to\nextract data from the image it does so and returns an object with all the \ninformation found, if an error occurs you will receive an error message. To\nprove that it really is easy please see the following example.\n\n    var ExifImage = require('exif').ExifImage;\n    \n    try {\n        new ExifImage({ image : 'myImage.jpg' }, function (error, image) {\n            if (error)\n                console.log('Error: '+error.message);\n            else\n                console.log(image); // Do something with your data!\n        });\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.log('Error: ' + error);\n    }\n\nInstead of providing a filename of an image in your filesystem you can also\npass a Buffer to ExifImage.\n\nThe data returned is an object with a couple of arrays, each of the arrays\nconsists of the metadata extracted from the respective section. Please refer\nto ExifImage.js for a list of available tags and their meaning, there is a lot\nof them. This is subject to change, though, as it's not really self explanatory\nright now.\n\nToDo / Ideas\n------------\n\n * Testing, testing, testing\n * Performance improvements\n * Better access to extracted data\n * Fetch remote files and extract metadata from them\n * Extract makernote information\n * Enhance interoperability information\n * Add string representations for flags\n * You name it  \n    \nLicense\n-------\n\n_node-exif_ is licensed under the MIT License.
